    <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">Welcome to Hogwarts,The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,
        Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble
        history and each has produced outstanding witches and
        wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will
        earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose
        house points. At the end of the year, the house with the
        most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I
        hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house
        becomes yours, The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes
        in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all
        smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are
        waiting.</h2>
